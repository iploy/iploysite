24574;fulltext_search;ob seekers often worry about how the fact that they are unemployed will be perceived by prospective employers, particularly if they have been out of work for a long period of time. Employers will often ask why you have been out of work for so long, and it&#39;s important to be prepared to answer.  One thing to keep in mind is that employers are more understanding of employment gaps in a down economy. In addition to high unemployment, there has also been a trend towards more hiring of temporary workers leaving more workers with time in between jobs. However, you still need to be prepared to respond to questions about the length of time you have been unemployed.  What&#39;s the best way to answer questions about being out of work? Even though you may really need a job, it&#39;s important to maintain a positive attitude and to provide a detailed and convincing explanation as to why the job you are interviewing for will be a good fit in terms of your skills and interests. Employers will be hesitant to hire you if they think you are randomly targeting jobs out of desperation because you have been unemployed for a long period of time. ;27.123.66.222;search=ob+seekers+often+worry+about+how+the+fact+that+they+are+unemployed+will+be+perceived+by+prospective+employers%2C+particularly+if+they+have+been+out+of+work+for+a+long+period+of+time.+Employers+will+often+ask+why+you+have+been+out+of+work+for+so+long%2C+and+it%27s+important+to+be+prepared+to+answer.++One+thing+to+keep+in+mind+is+that+employers+are+more+understanding+of+employment+gaps+in+a+down+economy.+In+addition+to+high+unemployment%2C+there+has+also+been+a+trend+towards+more+hiring+of+temporary+workers+leaving+more+workers+with+time+in+between+jobs.+However%2C+you+still+need+to+be+prepared+to+respond+to+questions+about+the+length+of+time+you+have+been+unemployed.++What%27s+the+best+way+to+answer+questions+about+being+out+of+work%3F+Even+though+you+may+really+need+a+job%2C+it%27s+important+to+maintain+a+positive+attitude+and+to+provide+a+detailed+and+convincing+explanation+as+to+why+the+job+you+are+interviewing+for+will+be+a+good+fit+in+terms+of+your+skills+and+interests.+Employers+will+be+hesitant+to+hire+you+if+they+think+you+are+randomly+targeting+jobs+out+of+desperation+because+you+have+been+unemployed+for+a+long+period+of+time.+&submit=Search&action=search&searchcategory=%25;http://www.iploy.co.uk/advice/index.php?sid=24574&lang=en&action=search&tagging_id=12;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1, rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0;1380450148;
